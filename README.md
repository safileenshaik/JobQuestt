Introduction

The current recruitment process is often inefficient, time-consuming, and lacks transparency, resulting in poor job matching and delayed communication between job seekers and recruiters. There is a need for an integrated solution that provides personalized recommendations, online assessments, and real-time updates to enhance the efficiency and user experience of the recruitment process.
                  The objective of this project is to design and develop a job portal that facilitates seamless interaction between job seekers, recruiters, and admins. The portal aims to enhance the recruitment process by providing features such as personalized job recommendations, online assessments, and application tracking, thereby improving efficiency and user experience for all stakeholders.
