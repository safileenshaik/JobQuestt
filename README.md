Introduction

The current recruitment process is often inefficient, time-consuming, and lacks transparency, resulting in poor job matching and delayed communication between job seekers and recruiters. There is a need for an integrated solution that provides personalized recommendations, online assessments, and real-time updates to enhance the efficiency and user experience of the recruitment process.
           The objective of this project is to design and develop a job portal that facilitates seamless interaction between job seekers, recruiters, and admins. The portal aims to enhance the recruitment process by providing features such as personalized job recommendations, online assessments, and application tracking, thereby improving efficiency and user experience for all stakeholders.

Additional Concepts to Include with Visuals
1.	Data Flow Diagrams (Figma): Show how data moves through the system.
2.	Explainability Tools: Include SHAP or LIME explanations with diagrams.
3.	Model Comparisons: Use tables and annotated performance graphs.
4.	Interactive Prototypes: Share clickable Figma prototypes for UI/UX.
5.	Scalable Architecture: Demonstrate cloud deployment with a Figma-rendered cloud diagram.
By integrating Figma visuals, your README will not only convey technical details effectively but also captivate the audience visually.







You should Include Architecture of your Project/ Design  / Result Screens:
Including Figma designs or images in a GitHub README.md can significantly enhance the visual appeal and clarity of your documentation. Below is a guide on how to incorporate them into the topics along with the necessary steps.
________________________________________
1. Prepare Your Figma Designs
1.	Create Diagrams/Designs:
o	Use Figma to design flowcharts, system architecture diagrams, data visualizations, or UI prototypes for your project.
o	Ensure your designs are clean and labeled properly.
2.	Export Figma Designs:
o	In Figma, select your design.
o	Click on File > Export or use the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + E.
o	Export as PNG, JPEG, or SVG based on your preference.
o	Save the images to your project directory (e.g., in a folder named assets).
________________________________________
2. Host Images on GitHub
1.	Upload Images:
o	Place your exported images in the project repository.
o	Create a folder named assets or images for better organization.
2.	Obtain Image URLs:
o	If the repository is public:
	Navigate to the uploaded image in your GitHub repository.
	Right-click the image and copy its URL.
o	For private repositories, use relative paths (e.g., ![Diagram](./assets/diagram.png)).
________________________________________
3. Add Images to README.md
1.	Basic Markdown Syntax for Images:
o	Use the following syntax to include images:
markdown
Copy code
![Alt Text](./assets/image_name.png)
o	Replace Alt Text with a description of the image for accessibility and ./assets/image_name.png with the relative path or URL.
2.	Embedding Figma Prototypes:
o	Figma allows embedding live prototypes using an iframe. For GitHub, include a link to the Figma prototype:
markdown
Copy code
[View Interactive Figma Design](https://figma.com/file/your-file-link)

5. Test the README Locally
1.	Open the README.md file in a Markdown previewer or GitHub to verify:
o	Images load correctly.
o	Figma links direct to the correct designs.
2.	If any image fails to load:
o	Check the file path.
o	Ensure the image was committed and pushed to the repository.
